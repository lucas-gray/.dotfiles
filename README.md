# Dotfiles
This is my Linux and MacOS configuration. I currently use Arch Linux with i3 and macOS Sequoia.

I've organized the location of each configuration to match where it goes on my system. I plan to automate deployment, but until then this allows me to easily symlink each file to its respective location.
